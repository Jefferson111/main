By: `Team SGTravel`      Since: `Aug 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SGTravel branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, SGTravel's architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of SGTravel. SGTravel adopts a n-tier style architecture where higher layers make use of services provided by lower layers. Here is a quick overview of each layer/component:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The user interface of the application
* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>: A collection of classes used by multiple other components
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The main controller of the entire application
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the application in-memory
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`SidePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/sgtravel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Recives commannd results from `Logic` component so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/sgtravel/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` and `ConversationManager` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an event).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying calendar to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/sgtravel/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `ProfileCard` object that represents the user's profile.
* stores the SGTravel data.
* the only class that is exposed to `Storage` component

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `ProfileCard` objects in .txt format and read it back.
* can save the SGTravel data in .txt format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `sgtravel.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Handling user input

==== Implementation

.Sequence diagram of how user input is handled
image::HandleUserInputDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how user input is handled:

.  The user types in a command into the terminal, and clicks on the kbd:[Enter] button.
.  Upon button press, the text in the input is read, if it is non-empty, the application will echo back the user’s input.
.  The `MainWindow` will then call `dukeResponse(input)`, which creates a thread using the `Platform` class.
.  A `CommandResult` object is created, and `dukeShow(result)` is called using this object.
.  If the result is of `CommandResultExit`, call `tryExitApp()`. Else if result is of `CommandResultCalender`, make a new `CalenderWindow` object with the result. Else if the result is of `CommandResultMap`, make a new `MapWindow` object.

=== Parsing of user input into command

==== Implementation

.Sequence diagram of how user input is parsed into a command
image::ParseCommandDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how user input is handled:

.  If the input is identified as a single line command (e.g. `help`, `list`), the appropriate command is returned.
.  Else, call `getCommandFromConversationManager(userInput)`, which will cause the `ConversationManager` to call `converse(userInput)`. 
.  In `ConversationManager`, `converse(userInput)` will check for the presence of a `Conversation`, and process the given user input to see if it is what the `Conversation` wants. For example, a `isDateInput(userInput)` will check if the given user input is a date, whereas an `isIntInput(userInput)` will check to see if it is an `Integer`). If it matches, an appropriate prompt is returned as a message, and the appropriate fields of the conversation is updated.
.  By checking if the `Conversation` in `ConversationManager` has ended, `parseComplexCommand(userInput)` will be called to try to parse the entire user input into a `Command`. Whereas if the `Conversation` has not ended, a `PromptCommand` is created by the `ConversationManager` using the `Conversation` and shown to the user.
.  The `LogicManager` will then execute the `Command` and return a `CommandResult` to the `Ui`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to allow both Single and Multi-step commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using `ConversationManager` to "accumulate" user input first before passing to `LogicManager` as a single step command when the accumulation is ready.
** Pros: No need to create new command classes.
** Pros: Can use the same key word to trigger both the single and multi-step commands based o the context.
** Pros: Does not block out single-step command even when the multi-step command is ongoing.
** Cons: Challenging to implement, exceptions need to be handled carefully.
* **Alternative 2:** Single and Multi-step commands are considered as different commands.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: We cannot use the same keywords to trigger both the multi-step and single-step command.
** Cons: There will be many different commands with overlapping code which violates DRY principle.
** Cons: Blocks out other commands while multi-step command is triggered.

=== Edit feature

==== Implementation

==== Design Considerations



=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME)`
* Log level can be indicated using `logger.log(Level.INFO, MESSAGE)` which logs messages according to the log level

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
